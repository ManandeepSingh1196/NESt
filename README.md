# 🕹️ NESt - NES Emulator (WIP)

A work-in-progress Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator written in C++, inspired by [OneLoneCoder’s NES Emulator guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrOv9FMX8xJEnQ6p2VUV7TL4pjaK6nK8n) and the [NESDev Wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki).

Currently implemented up through the **PPU (Picture Processing Unit)** stage, capable of rendering backgrounds, tiles, and basic graphics output.
